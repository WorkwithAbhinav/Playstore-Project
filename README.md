### Steps Involved
- **Importing libraries**
  - Step one involves importing all the libraries used for data preprocessing, visualization, and modeling.

- **Loading the datasets**
  - Importing the CSV file containing data from the Play Store.

- **Initial Data Analysis**
  - This stage involves...

- **Preprocessing**
  - Refining raw materials before crafting a masterpiece involves cleaning, transforming, and organizing data to enhance its quality and usability.

- **Data Cleaning**
  - Clearing all null values and making replacements where necessary.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**
  - Visualizing data using different techniques for a better understanding.

- **Data Splitting**
  - Splitting the data into training and test datasets.

- **Modeling**
  - Using various classification modeling methods to determine the best-suited approach and applying it.
